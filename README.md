# Event Finder App - Group 4 | Project 1

Project 1 provided the task of using everything we've learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that weâ€™ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The project requirements are as follows:

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

**Project Description**

We created an Event Finder App that locates events in your area on a specific date using the Ticketmaster and Mapbox APIs. 

To use the app, users will enter their city into the textbox located at the bottom of the modal on the homepage. Once submitted, that information will be stored locally for future use.

The user will then need to enter their desired date using the date picker on the right side of the header. When the user clicks 'Search,' the results populate in the main section of the page.

The act's name will be highlighted in orange. This serves as a hyperlink that directs the user to the Ticketmaster event page.

From there, the user will purchase their tickets through Ticketmaster and rock on!
